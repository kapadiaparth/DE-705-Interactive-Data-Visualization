## DE 705: Interactive Data Visualization

12 students from the M.Des in Interaction Design program took a 3-week long course in Interactive Data Visualization. Total duration of class was five and half days (Approx 30 hours) coupled up with a 3 day long (Approx 19 hours) Geo-Viz workshop conducted by Mr. Rasagy Sharma from Mapbox.

As the name suggests, the course emphasized on the interactive aspect of data visualization. Every student had to apply their knowledge and understanding of interface/interaction principles into creating meaningful interaction with information. The class did data collection, analysis and visualization as part of the coursework, and completed 3 assignments. Also certain additional assignments were done pertaining to Geo-Visualization.
