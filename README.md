## DE 705: Interactive Data Visualization

12 students from the M.Des in Interaction Design program took a 3-week long course in Interactive Data Visualization. Total duration of class was five and half days (Approx 30 hours) coupled up with a 3 day long (Approx 19 hours) Geo-Viz workshop conducted by Mr. Rasagy Sharma from Mapbox.

As the name suggests, the course emphasized on the interactive aspect of data visualization. Every student had to apply their knowledge and understanding of interface/interaction principles into creating meaningful interaction with information. The class did data collection, analysis and visualization as part of the coursework, and completed 3 assignments. Also certain additional assignments were done pertaining to Geo-Visualization.



### Kerala Floods data visualization (Assignment 3)

Students were asked to look for suitable data sets related to the recent Kerala floods (2018). As a part of assignment every student was supposed to communicate an insight, observation, understanding, perspective or story through data.

>_Assignment was evaluated on basis of:_ <br />
_1. Individual's ability to understand and handle the relevant data_ <br />
_2. analysis of the said data_ <br />
_3. correctly encoding it using the appropriate viz design principles, and_ <br />
_4. using the selected tool to best achieve a coherent communication._ <br />

Also students had to document and articulate their design process in the form of a Medium article.
